Handle Potential Data Quality Issues
Data Cleaning: Ensure that the data is cleaned and standardized. For instance, remove leading/trailing spaces, standardize cases (upper/lower), and handle special characters if necessary.
Null Handling: Use COALESCE or IFNULL functions to handle null values gracefully.
